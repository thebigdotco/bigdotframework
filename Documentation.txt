To edit the address that the contact form sends emails to, open up message.php
This should be a carbon copy of your contact page, where the form itself is replaced by the PHP that starts on line 128 (in the original template)
Change the fields starting with $ to your own information.
You may also want to set the page to no-index, as it is in the template.
